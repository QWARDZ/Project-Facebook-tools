# ðŸ“° INSTRUCTION/GUIDE NOTE

```python

- TEMPORARY EMAIL - Generate an email using: `gen tag [example: gen edward]`. To check the email, use: `[check generated email]`.

- FB SHARE - First, create an account using a temporary email. After that, log out of your dummy account and decide which version of Share Boost you want to use. For me, version 2 is preferable since I don't need to obtain a token. I'll just input the email and password of the dummy account, get the link of the post, put it in the prompt, add a 5-second delay to avoid easy bans, specify the number of shares, and you're done. Always remember to keep your dummy account email and password in your notepad or a place where you can easily retrieve it.

- FB FOLLOW - First, create an account using a temporary email. After that, create a page. Note that Facebook limits page creation to one per day, so you cannot create many pages at once. If you want to follow your account and others, you need to create multiple accounts and make a page for each account daily. Add a page for each account you create to follow. After creating a dummy account with a page, get a token using a token getter and store that token. Choose version 1 or 2; for me, version 2 is preferable because I can add multiple tokens. After that, get the Facebook link you want to follow, and you're done.

- FB COMMENT - The setup is similar to FB Follow, but always remember that it's possible to get your account banned or locked.

```
ðŸ“ŒNote: Do not use your private account; always use a dummy account when utilizing these tools. Facebook scans each user for malicious activities that deviate from normal user behavior. Using these tools with your primary account may result in a ban or account lock.
